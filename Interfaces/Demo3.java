    //When you define a new class, consider if it makes sense for
    //instances of your class to be compared to do things such as
    //sorting. If so, your class should implement the Comparable<T>
    //interface. To do this you need to:
    //a. Include the clause implements Comparable<T> in the class header
    //right after the class name replacing T with the class's name.
    //b. Implement a compareTo method having the signature:
    //int compareTo(T other) where T is the type parameter.
    //1. Copy your Adventurer + Warrior classes into this directory.
    //2. Try to compile the code below before you make Warrior Comparable.
    //3. Modify the Warrior so that it is comparable as per directions above.
    //dont forget:
    // implements Comparable<Warrior>
    // public int compareTo(Warrior other)
    //4 about compareTo():
    //How can we compare warriors? What determines less than or greater?
    //We must pick one measure of a warriors greatness.
    //To make it simple, More HP means the warrior is greater.
    //5. Test to see if the sorting now works with Warriors.
    //How do you know it worked?
    //How can you verify this?
    //Your toString in Warrior doesn't help us, what can you do?
